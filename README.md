Data Analytics of TMDB movie data base

## Introduction

> For my project I chose TMDB which contains movie data. I will first load my work and clean it up before taking a closer look at the data to complete the eight research questions I have come up with, to see how profitability, popularity, budgets and revenus influence the Movie industry.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

##### Research Question 1: Find the Min and Max Movie through finding its profit value.
##### Research Question 2:  What Movie is the highest and lowest for budget and revenue?
##### Research Question 3:  What are the top 15 Profitable movies and the top 15 least profitable movies?
##### Research Question 4:  What have the Genres ranked from 1960-2015?
##### Research Question 5:  Who is the most frequent Actor or Actress used in movies?
##### Research Question 6:  Let take a closer look at Movies being released each year and find a production value for each year from 1960-2015.
##### Research Question 7:  Let's now find the most common key word, and how keywords associate with popularity.
##### Research Question 8:  Which director has the most films, and how do they compare with popularity.

Research Question 1: Find the Min and Max Movie through finding its profit value.

Conclusion:-By finding profit it was discovered the Avatar was the highest profiting movie and the warrior’s way yielded the least profit.

Research Question 2: What Movie is the highest and lowest for budget and revenue?

Conclusion:-	After finding the movie with the highest and lowest profit now its time to look at the movies in the budget and revenue columns to see the highest and lowest. It seems The Warriors Way had the highest budget and Mr.Holmes had the lowest at zero. This could have been one of our missing values we filled from missing data.  As for the Highest movie revenue goes to Avtar and with Wild Card being in last with Zero. Could this be another one of our missing data sets or did this movie not get released.
I’m curious what would happen if maybe we dropped the null values instead of filling them and see how much that fill might change the overall outcomes. for budget, revenue and profit.
    Exploring further into the movies with High budget and revenue I found the follow for the top 15.
Top 15 Budget
-	The Warrior’s Way
-	Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides
-	Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End
-	Avenger: Age of Ultron
-	Superman Returns

-	Frozen
-	Iron Man 3
-	Minions
-	Transformers: Dark of the Moon
-	The Lord f the Rings: The Return of the King
-	Skyfall
-	The Net

I find both these list’s to be familiar and some personal favorites being included.  I find it amazing that for top Revenue there are two movies from the 90s that placed high. Taking a closure look it shows Avengers: Age of Ultron not only had a high budget but also a high revenue, very close with the Harry Potter Deathly Hallows movies. It seems Part 1 had a high budget, but Part 2 placed higher for revenue. Was the budget before the movie was released separately? That is another question that could have further research. 

Research Question 3: What are the top 15 Profitable movies and the top 15 least profitable movies?

Conclusion:Exploring further into the movies with Highest profit and revenue matched along with lowest profitable top15 movies, I found the follow for the top 15.

Research Question 4: What have the Genres ranked from 1960-2015?

Conclusion: Amazingly from 1960-2015 the top genres for movies are starting at first place Drama, second Comedy, third Thriller, fourth Action, and fifth Romance. I was a little shocked to see Drama at number one and Action at number 4. It seems earlier movies to present have included more traces of drama through out the production of movies. Which goes to answer most individual just might prefer onscreen drama than real life!

Research Question 5: Who is the most frequent Actor or Actress used in movies?

Conclusion:The results for most frequent Actor and Actress surprised me. Having Robert De Niro and Sameuel L. Jackson as top two doesn’t fully surprise me but the remaining top 10 does. Among the top ten are great actors but only one actress which goes to Susan Sarandon. I expanded the list to view where are actresses might place and found Julianne Moore at twelfth, Meryl Streep at twenty-fourth place and Nicole Kidman at thirty.  It seems Marilyn Was right when she said it was a man’s world. I would love to see how an updated list might place these actors and actress in present 2020.

Research Question 6: Let take a closer look at Movies being released each year and find a production value for each year from 1960-2015.

Conclusion:The data I found with movies being released from 1960-2015 was shocking it goes from 31 movies being released in 1961 up to 700 in 2014! It seems Hollywood classics would be classics cause when they were released there was barley any competition making them easily fan favorites. However seeing 700 being released in 2014 I could only tell you the movies that grossed the most at the box office created more the impression. It does show for 2015 Movie makers only produced 629 movies. A slight decrease perhaps movie goers are finding it harder to keep up with movies and instead saving their times for the popular, higher budgeted movies to experience.

Research Question 7: Let's now find the most common key word, and how keywords associate with popularity.

Conclusion: Searching the keywords to movies I discovered woman director has the highest count, with independent film and sport in second and third. At the tenth place it is then independent film/ woman director. I think that’s fantastic to see woman director as the top keyword. I wanted to dig a little deeper so I choose which keywords went with the most popular and found monsters, dna, tyrannosaurus rex, velociraptor and island in the top most popular choice for movie. With the second popular choice including future, chase, post-apocalyptic, dystopia, Australia.  Reading these key words of the top 10 most popular brings each movie title quick to mind.

Research Question 8: Which director has the most films, and how do they compare with popularity.

Conclusion:Search for the director with the top movies made I found Woody Allen at number one with Clint Eastwood at second, martin Scorsese at third and Steven Spielberg at fourth. Switching gears and looking into the a director based on popularity I found Colin Trevorrow at number one, George Miller second, Christopher Nolan at third and James Gunn at fourth. That really is quite a different list to go by and provides to very valuable insights to the director that had directed the most vs a director that has more popularity based from their movie giving notion to quality vs quantity or vice versa?
